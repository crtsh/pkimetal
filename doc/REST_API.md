# pkimetal: REST API Documentation

## OpenAPI

An [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) definition for pkimetal is provided by [openapi.yaml](/doc/openapi.yaml).

This powers the Stoplight workspace at https://pkimetal.stoplight.io/docs/pkimetal/68a341c676710-pkimetal-api.

## POST parameters

The HTTP POST API endpoints all accept the following common parameters:

Name | Required? | Default Value | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
b64input | Required | n/a | The Base64 or PEM-encoded input.
format | Optional | json, or as configured | The desired response format.
profile | Optional | autodetect | The name of the profile that the input is intended to match.
severity | Optional | meta | The minimum severity level of linter findings that should be included in the response.

Each API also supports a purpose-specific alternative name for `b64input`.

The response `format` must be one of the following options:

- html
- json
- text

Use the [profiles](#get-endpoints) GET endpoint to list the supported values for `profile`.

The minimum `severity` must be one of the following options:

- meta
- debug
- info
- notice
- warning
- error
- bug
- fatal

The "meta" severity level includes informational "findings" added by pkimetal itself. The other severity levels are used for the findings of the various linters.
